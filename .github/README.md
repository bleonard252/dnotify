# DNotify
<!--Insert some badges from https://shields.io
(Mostly a License, Issues open badges (can also be localized, website and ci/deploy badges))-->

 - :speaker: **Listen** for notifications
 - :speech_balloon: **Send** notifications on behalf of your app

## How to use
Currently, dnotify doesn't have binaries, so you can test it by cloning and running these commands in different terminals from within the repository:
```sh
# Terminal 1
dart bin/dnotifyd.dart
# This will keep running in the background
```
```sh
# Terminal 2
dart bin/dnotify.dart --help
```
* **`Pro Tip:`** you can add `&` after the first command to use the same terminal!
* **`Note:`** With `dnotify` tool in verbose mode, you'll get duplicate output.
